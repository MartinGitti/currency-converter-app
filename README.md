## Use of code:
<p>I'd suggest using a text editor to open the project in like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code which is my preferred text editor.</p>
<p>Cd to the root of the project directory and install the node-modules in order to run the web page in the browser.</p>
<p>To install the node-modules, type "npm i" |or| "npm install" in the command line interface or terminal.</p>
<p>Once the node-modules are installed, type "npm start" to run the web page in the browser.</p>
